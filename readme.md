Simple linear regression with a single variable has two learnable coefficients,
the formula is:

```
f(x) = ax + b
```

This project visualizes the values of the RMSE error relative to the selection
of a and b as a heatmap. On the left side you see the data points and the
regression line, on the right you see the heatmap with a on the x-axis and b on
the y-axis.
Moving the mouse over the heatmap changes the regression line.
Clicking on the heatmap displays a regression line with the corresponding
coefficients permanently.
